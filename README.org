#+DESCRIPTION: Basic project description for Crypto Accounting
#+LANGUAGE: en
#+SETUPFILE: config/theme-bigblow.setup

A library and set of tools for accounting with multiple currencies and/or commodities, inspired by and mostly interoperable with [[https://www.ledger-cli.org/3.0/doc/ledger3.html][Ledger-Cli]], with ideas from [[https://github.com/feramhq/transity][Transity]].

* Goals
- Uses a human-readable input format.  This is YAML by default, although see the next goal.
- Can convert or hopefully directly use a subset of the Ledger format.
- Can insert price histories for settlement to arbitrary base currencies, USD by default
- Can calculate lot prices, average entry price
- The final output file (or fileset) should ideally be fully-self-contained, allowing for a full accounting to USD capital gains and income statements with no outside interface needed.
